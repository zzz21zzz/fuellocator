            <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
            <p>
                Fuel Scarcity is a big problem in our home country, Nigeria, and because of this, thousands of people spend over 120 minutes queuing up for fuel, only to get to the front of the lines to see there is no fuel. And because of the congested traffic, itâ€™s hard to make a decision on which fuel station to go to. Also because of the congestion, any wrong decision means you're stuck wherever you chose!
            </p>
            <p>
                Not very good sounding, I suppose... But enough whining over a problem of the past.
